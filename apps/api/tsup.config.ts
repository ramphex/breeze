  // 'mailparser' and 'v9u-smb2' are third-party runtime dependencies of the built-in
  // ee/workspace extension (bundled above via @breeze/ext-workspace) that are NOT among

  // dependency closure into the runner image's node_modules (docker/Dockerfile.api's
  // `pnpm deploy --prod`; apps/api/Dockerfile's direct node_modules copy) -- neither
  // provisions ee/workspace's node_modules at runtime. Left off this list, tsup would
  // still attempt to bundle them by default (they're absent from apps/api's own
  // package.json, so tsup's "external = apps/api's declared deps" heuristic wouldn't
  // externalize them either) -- but that's an ACCIDENT of apps/api not happening to
  // depend on them itself, not a decision, and it would silently break (dangling
  // `require()` in dist/index.cjs, "Cannot find module" at boot) if apps/api ever gained
  // its own same-named dependency for an unrelated reason. Listing them here makes the
  // inlining a deliberate, explicit contract instead. Both are pure JS with no native
  // bindings (verified: no `gypfile`, no `.node` binaries in their dependency trees) --
  // safe to bundle. See apps/api/src/config/extensionBundledDependencies.test.ts for the
  // guard that keeps this list in sync with ee/workspace/package.json.
  //
  // Anything ee/workspace depends on that IS also one of apps/api's own dependencies
  // (today: @anthropic-ai/sdk, drizzle-orm, hono, zod) is deliberately left OFF this
  // list: it stays external and resolves from apps/api's own deployed node_modules,
  // which pnpm already dedupes at install time -- smaller bundle, one copy on disk.
