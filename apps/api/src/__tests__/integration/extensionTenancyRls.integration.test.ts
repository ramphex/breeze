/**
 * Real-DB contract test for the extension RLS tripwire (#2424).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: the unit tests over this tripwire mock `db.execute`,
 * so they assert the *verdict logic* but prove nothing about the
 * catalog query itself. That gap already bit once — the first cut of this
 * assertion embedded the table list as `= ANY(${tables})`, which drizzle
 * expands into a TUPLE (`= ANY(($1, $2, ...))`) that Postgres rejects outright.
 * Every mocked test passed while the real query would have crashed the boot
 * with a SQL syntax error instead of an RLS verdict — a tripwire that only
 * ever fired the wrong alarm.
 *
 * So this suite runs `assertExtensionTenancyRls` against REAL Postgres, over
 * fixture tables that reproduce each failure mode. It is the only thing that
 * can prove the tripwire actually reads the catalog and actually distinguishes
 * a compliant extension table from a non-compliant one.
 */

/**
 * NOTE — these fixtures deliberately have NO `org_id` column. Do not add one.
 *
 * `rls-coverage.integration.test.ts` auto-discovers org-tenant tables purely by
 * `column_name = 'org_id'` and then asserts RLS enabled + forced + policies.
 * It runs against the SAME CI database as this suite. Three of these fixtures
 * are intentionally RLS-broken, so giving them an `org_id` would make a leaked
 * fixture (hook timeout, worker crash, cancelled run — anything that skips
 * `afterAll`) look exactly like a real cross-tenant breach to the repo's
 * highest-signal alarm, and `cleanupDatabase`'s TRUNCATE hand-list would never
 * DROP an unknown table, so it would keep failing on unrelated PRs.
 *
 * The column buys the test nothing — `assertExtensionTenancyRls` reads only
 * `pg_class` / `pg_policies` and never inspects columns.
