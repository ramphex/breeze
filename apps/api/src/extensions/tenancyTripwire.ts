 *     exist with RLS ENABLEd + FORCEd and at least one policy.
 *  2. **Existing → declared** (#2466). Every `<name>_`-prefixed table that
 *     actually exists in the catalog must appear SOMEWHERE in the manifest —
 *     either in a tenancy array (and then rule 1 applies to it) or in the
 *     explicit `nonTenantTables` opt-out. Direction 1 alone let the policed
 *     party write its own policy: an extension whose migration created
 *     `<name>_docs(org_id …)` and whose manifest simply omitted it got no check
 *     at all, and shipped with no RLS.
 *
 * The `nonTenantTables` opt-out is verified, not trusted: a table listed there
 * fails the boot if it carries a tenant COLUMN (TENANT_SCOPE_COLUMNS) or a
 * FOREIGN KEY into a core tenant entity (CORE_TENANT_FK_TABLES). The FK half is
 * what makes this a check rather than a naming convention — an extension can
 * call its column `organization_id` and dodge the name match, but not the key.
 *
 * SCOPE — what this does NOT prove. Ownership is inferred from the `<name>_`
 * prefix in schema `public`. The prefix is enforced on manifest DECLARATIONS
 * (packages/extension-sdk), never on the DDL an extension's migration actually
 * runs. A table created unprefixed, or in a non-public schema, is not caught
 * here. `assertNoUnaccountedPublicTables` below closes the unprefixed case
 * repo-wide; the non-public-schema case remains open and is tracked separately —
 * closing it properly means recording table ownership at migration time rather
 * than inferring it from a string.
 *
 * Throws (failing the boot loudly) on any violation. Exported for tests.
