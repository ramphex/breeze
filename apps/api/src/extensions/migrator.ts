/**
 * Transactional migrator for a single runtime extension.
 *
 * An extension's SQL migrations are applied into the SAME `breeze_migrations`
 * ledger as core migrations, under namespaced filenames (`<extension>/<file>`),
 * reusing the core boot loop's `hashSql` / `recordMigration` / `MIGRATION_TABLE`
 * so there is exactly one migration-tracking implementation.
 *
 * Concurrency contract (the load-bearing part):
 *   - The whole locked section runs on ONE dedicated connection obtained via
 *     `sql.reserve()`. A SESSION-level `pg_advisory_lock` is taken on that
 *     reserved connection, every per-file `reserved.begin()` transaction runs on
 *     it, and the matching `pg_advisory_unlock` runs on it too. Because a
 *     session advisory lock is per-connection, pinning all three to the reserved
 *     connection is what makes the lock actually protect the migration set that
 *     spans multiple sequential transactions. (A transaction-scoped
 *     `pg_advisory_xact_lock` would release after the first file — wrong here.)
 *   - The applied-set is loaded AFTER the lock is held, so a second caller that
 *     was blocked on the lock sees the first caller's committed rows and skips
 *     them. Two concurrent callers for the same extension therefore apply the
 *     set exactly once.
 *
 * Each pending file executes wholesale inside one `reserved.begin`, and its
 * namespaced ledger row is inserted in that SAME transaction — so a file that
 * fails rolls back with no ledger row (nothing half-applied, nothing recorded).
