/**
 * The disabled built-in's table-existence probe, against a REAL Postgres.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `defaultExistingDeclaredTables` is the one piece of the
 * disabled path that no unit test can reach: `builtinExtensions.test.ts` drives
 * everything through injected ports, so the port's own SQL is stubbed out in
 * every one of those tests. That gap has already cost once — the first version
 * of this query bound the table names as a `text[]` parameter, which passed the
 * whole unit suite and then failed against a live server with `malformed array
 * literal`, aborting boot for every deployment that had ever enabled the
 * built-in. The query is now an `IN ${sql([...])}` list over `pg_class`; this
 * suite is what proves that shape actually executes and returns the right subset
 * for the three cases the caller distinguishes:
 *
 *   - NONE present   → publish nothing (declaring absent tables would point
 *                      cascade/export SQL at relations that do not exist).
 *   - SOME present   → publish a declaration FILTERED to the present subset.
 *   - ALL present    → publish the whole declaration.
 *
 * A >1-element list is used throughout on purpose: the binding bug that
 * motivated this file only appears with multiple names.
 *
 * DATABASE. It provisions its OWN throwaway database rather than using the
 * shared `breeze_test`, for two reasons: this test CREATEs and DROPs tables in
 * `public`, and a stray leftover there would read as an "unaccounted public
 * table" to every other suite's tenancy tripwire; and the probe needs no core
 * schema at all, so there is nothing to gain from migrating one. The name
 * matches the test-DB safety allowlist (`/^breeze_test(_[a-z0-9]+)?$/`), and
 * `DROP DATABASE ... WITH (FORCE)` runs first so an interrupted previous run
 * cannot leave anything behind. Mutating `process.env.DATABASE_URL` around the
 * calls is safe ONLY because the integration config sets `fileParallelism:
 * false` (vitest.integration.config.ts), so no other suite is connected while
 * the variable is swapped.
