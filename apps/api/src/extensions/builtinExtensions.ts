// The startup loading path for BUILT-IN extensions: first-party extensions that
// are compiled into the core image and imported statically. This is the ONLY
// extension delivery path — the legacy source-directory loader and the signed
// runtime-bundle reconciler are both gone.
//
// Compiled in ≠ loaded. Each built-in carries a deployment enable flag
// (BuiltinExtension.enableEnvVar) and is OFF by default; only an explicitly
// enabled built-in runs the pipeline below. See skipDisabledBuiltin for what a
// switched-off built-in still does (one log line, plus a tenancy declaration
// narrowed to whichever of its tables are actually on the database — none, some

// asset. There is no acquire / trust / verify / extract phase: the code is
// already here, already ours, already covered by the core image's own supply
// chain.

// Failure policy: a built-in is first-party REQUIRED code shipped inside the
// image, so any phase failure propagates and aborts boot. There is no
// half-working built-in state to preserve, and silently degrading one would
// hide a broken image.
//
// Every I/O seam is an injectable PORT, so these behaviors are unit-testable

 *
 * No migrations, no staging, no activation, no `installed_extensions` row, no
 * web-dist requirement: a deployment that never enabled this built-in must boot
 * on plain Postgres with none of the built-in's infrastructure.
 *
 * Tenancy is the one exception, and it cuts BOTH ways:
 *
 *   • If the built-in's tables EXIST (a previous boot had it enabled and its
 *     migrations ran), the declaration must still be published. The repo-wide
 *     `assertNoUnaccountedPublicTables` sweep would otherwise read those
 *     orphaned `workspace_*` tables as belonging to no manifest and abort boot,
 *     and org-deletion cascades would silently skip the rows in them.
 *   • If they DO NOT exist, publishing is actively harmful: core cascade,
 *     device-move and tenant-export code iterates the declared tables and
 *     issues SQL against each one, which would now name relations that were
 *     never created.
 *
 * And the two cases are not exhaustive: a PARTIAL schema is a real, reachable
 * state. Enabling the built-in on a database that cannot satisfy its migrations
 * aborts boot mid-sequence, leaving the tables from the files that DID commit
 * and none from the files that did not. (Concretely: workspace on a stock
 * `postgres:16-alpine` gets three of its migration files applied and dies on the
 * fourth's `CREATE EXTENSION vector`.) Unsetting the flag then reaches this
 * function with SOME tables present. Publishing the manifest's WHOLE declaration
 * there would point org-cascade and tenant-export SQL at the relations that were
 * never created — the exact harm the second bullet describes, just triggered by
 * a half-finished migration run instead of a never-started one.
 *
 * So the probe returns the present SUBSET and what gets published is a
 * declaration FILTERED to it. That is safe in both directions: the
 * unaccounted-table sweep only examines tables that EXIST, so a filtered
 * declaration still accounts for every one of them, while cascade/export/
 * device-move never name a missing relation. A partial set also earns a
 * structured warning — a half-migrated built-in is an operator problem, not a
 * steady state.
 *
 * Finally, the published declaration gets the SAME boot-time RLS tripwire the
 * enabled path applies. Orphaned tables still hold tenant rows; whether the
 * feature is switched on has no bearing on whether those rows are protected.
