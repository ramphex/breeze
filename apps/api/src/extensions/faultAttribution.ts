 * Fault attribution for runtime extensions.

 * When an unhandled rejection or uncaught exception tears through the process,

 *
 * CRITICAL CONTRACT: attribution ADDS a name (for a log line / Sentry tag) and
 * NOTHING ELSE. It never inspects, swallows, or resolves the fault. The process
 * crash/exit(1)/captureException behavior in the fault handlers is unchanged;
 * this only enriches the telemetry so an operator can see WHICH extension is
 * the likely culprit instead of an anonymous stack.
