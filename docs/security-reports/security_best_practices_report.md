# Security Best Practices Review Report

Split report index: [README.md](./README.md)

Date: 2026-03-30
Repository: /Users/toddhebebrand/breeze
Reviewer mode: `security-best-practices`

## Executive Summary

I reviewed the current Breeze codebase with a security focus on authentication, authorization, remote-control flows, token handling, and externally reachable endpoints in the Node/TypeScript API, Astro/React web app, and supporting Go agent paths that materially affect the web/API trust boundary.

The first remediation pass fixed the original four findings around `dev/push`, browser token persistence, desktop viewer token scoping, and MFA setup verification. Subsequent remediation passes also fixed the agent WebSocket orphaned-result trust issue, helper output sanitization/scope enforcement gaps, and several adjacent API authorization inconsistencies in deployment, software, script-library, sensitive-data, and monitoring routes.

Current unresolved high-confidence findings documented in this report: **0**

The remaining work is continued audit coverage, not a currently open known issue from the findings tracked below.

## Method

1. Mapped the active stack and loaded targeted guidance for Node/TypeScript backend, React frontend, and Go components.
2. Reviewed bootstrap middleware, auth/session flows, CORS/CSRF handling, and token issuance.
3. Traced high-risk routes including remote session flows, WebSocket ticketing, agent-control endpoints, and API-key-protected endpoints.
4. Reviewed browser token storage patterns and privileged deep-link flows.
5. Confirmed findings against current code and line references rather than relying on the older report already present in the repo.

## Historical Findings Already Remediated

### F-001: `dev/push` allows privileged agent updates without permission or MFA checks
Rule ID: EXPRESS-AUTHZ-001
Severity: High
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/devPush.ts:46](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/devPush.ts:46)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/devPush.ts:60](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/devPush.ts:60)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/devPush.ts:71](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/devPush.ts:71)

Evidence:
- The route is only gated by environment availability, not by RBAC or MFA.
- When `X-API-Key` is present, `devPushAuth` calls `apiKeyAuthMiddleware` directly and never applies `requireApiKeyScope(...)`.
- When JWT auth is used, `devPushAuth` only applies `requireScope('organization', 'partner', 'system')`; it does not apply `requirePermission(...)` or `requireMfa()`.

Impact:
- If `dev/push` is reachable in an environment, any authenticated org user or any active org API key can upload and trigger a custom agent binary on devices they can see in that org. That is effectively remote code execution on managed endpoints without a high-assurance authorization check.

Fix:
- Gate the route with `requirePermission(PERMISSIONS.DEVICES_EXECUTE.resource, PERMISSIONS.DEVICES_EXECUTE.action)` and `requireMfa()` for user auth.
- For API keys, require a dedicated scope such as `devices:execute` before allowing binary upload or agent update operations.
- Consider restricting the route to explicit admin-only environments, or disabling API-key access entirely for this endpoint.

Mitigation:
- Keep `DEV_PUSH_ENABLED` off outside tightly controlled developer environments.
- Audit existing API keys for broad deployment use if this route has ever been enabled in shared environments.

False positive notes:
- This issue is conditional on the route being enabled or running in a non-production environment. The authorization gap itself is real in code today.

### F-002: The web app persists bearer access tokens in browser storage
Rule ID: REACT-CONFIG-001
Severity: Medium
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/web/src/stores/auth.ts:41](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/web/src/stores/auth.ts:41)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/web/src/stores/auth.ts:85](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/web/src/stores/auth.ts:85)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/web/src/stores/auth.ts:278](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/web/src/stores/auth.ts:278)

Evidence:
- The Zustand `persist(...)` configuration stores `tokens` under the `breeze-auth` local-storage key.
- `fetchWithAuth()` then reads that access token and places it in the `Authorization` header for API requests.

Impact:
- Any XSS in the Breeze web origin, or a malicious browser extension with page access, can exfiltrate a live bearer token and replay API calls as the user. Because the app already uses an HttpOnly refresh-cookie flow, persisting the access token increases blast radius without being strictly necessary.

Fix:
- Keep access tokens in memory only and rely on the existing refresh-cookie flow to restore them after page reload.
- If persistence is required, reduce scope and lifetime aggressively and consider binding tokens to a narrower audience or interaction.

Mitigation:
- Maintain a strict CSP and continue avoiding dangerous DOM sinks, but do not treat CSP as a substitute for keeping bearer credentials out of script-readable storage.

False positive notes:
- This is a code-level storage design issue, not proof of a current XSS bug.

### F-003: Desktop deep-link exchange mints a normal user API token instead of a viewer-scoped token
Rule ID: EXPRESS-AUTH-002
Severity: Medium
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/remote/sessions.ts:574](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/remote/sessions.ts:574)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/remote/sessions.ts:577](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/remote/sessions.ts:577)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/desktopWs.ts:583](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/desktopWs.ts:583)

Evidence:
- `desktop-connect-code` stores the caller's full token claims (`sub`, `email`, `roleId`, `orgId`, `partnerId`, `scope`, `mfa`) inside the one-time code payload.
- `/desktop-ws/connect/exchange` converts that payload directly into a fresh access token via `createAccessToken(codeRecord.tokenPayload)`.

Impact:
- Any process that obtains a valid desktop connect code can exchange it for a general Breeze API bearer token with the user's normal scope, rather than a token restricted to the remote-viewer flow. That unnecessarily widens the consequences of deep-link interception or compromise of the local viewer app.

Fix:
- Mint a dedicated viewer/session token with a separate audience or token type, scoped to the specific remote session and limited to desktop-viewer endpoints only.
- Reject viewer tokens everywhere outside the viewer/session exchange path.

Mitigation:
- Keep connect-code TTLs short and one-time, but treat that as defense-in-depth rather than sufficient scoping.

False positive notes:
- The one-time code design is good; the issue is the breadth of the exchanged token after redemption.

### F-004: MFA setup confirmation bypasses standard auth middleware and does not enforce access-token type
Rule ID: EXPRESS-AUTH-003
Severity: Medium
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/auth/mfa.ts:219](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/auth/mfa.ts:219)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/auth/mfa.ts:225](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/auth/mfa.ts:225)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/auth/mfa.ts:231](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/auth/mfa.ts:231)

Evidence:
- The setup-confirmation branch of `/auth/mfa/verify` manually reads the `Authorization` header and calls `verifyToken(token)` instead of using `authMiddleware`.
- That branch checks revocation, but it never enforces `payload.type === 'access'` and never re-validates user status through the standard middleware path.

Impact:
- This creates a privileged endpoint with weaker token semantics than the rest of the app. If a refresh token or other signed JWT for the same user is disclosed outside the intended cookie path, it could be accepted here even though the route is conceptually an authenticated user action.

Fix:
- Replace the bespoke header parsing with `authMiddleware` for the authenticated setup-confirmation path.
- If the route must stay split between login-time MFA verification and authenticated MFA setup, explicitly require `payload.type === 'access'` and an active user record in the setup-confirmation branch.

Mitigation:
- Keep refresh tokens HttpOnly and out of application logs, but still normalize this route to the same auth contract as the rest of the API.

False positive notes:
- Exploitability depends on obtaining a signed JWT outside the normal access-token path. The route inconsistency is still real and worth fixing.

## Residual Risks And Gaps

- I did not complete a dependency-vulnerability sweep in this pass. The workspace `pnpm audit` command did not accept the recursive invocation I expected, so this report is grounded in code review rather than package-advisory output.
- I did not validate edge/CDN/runtime headers outside the app code. CSP, TLS termination, WAF, and ingress controls should still be verified in deployed environments.
- I did not perform dynamic testing against a running instance, so any runtime-only controls or regressions were not exercised.

## Follow-up Findings (Remediated)

### F-005: Agent WebSocket orphaned result handling trusts agent-supplied target IDs without rebinding them to the authenticated device
Rule ID: GO-AUTHZ-001
Severity: High
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts:190](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts:190)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts:204](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts:204)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts:233](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts:233)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts:445](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts:445)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts:496](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts:496)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts:1077](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts:1077)

Evidence:
- For non-UUID `command_result` messages, `processCommandResult()` calls `processOrphanedCommandResult()` directly instead of rebinding the result to `authenticatedAgent.deviceId`.
- The SNMP orphan path accepts `result.result.deviceId` and enqueues metric processing for that supplied device ID.
- The monitor orphan path accepts `result.result.monitorId` and records status for that supplied monitor ID.
- UUID-backed orphan flows for discovery, backup, and restore jobs also resolve by job ID alone and do not check that the submitting agent was the agent originally selected for the work.
- In the same file, `ipHistoryUpdate.deviceId` is explicitly rejected when it does not match the authenticated device, which shows the safer binding pattern is already understood elsewhere in this code.

Impact:
- Any authenticated agent connection can inject or overwrite monitor, SNMP, discovery, backup, or restore state outside its own device boundary if it can submit crafted orphaned results. For non-UUID monitor and SNMP results, this does not require guessing a stored command row at all because the API trusts the target identifiers embedded in the payload.

Fix:
- Bind every result path to the authenticated device or an expected pending command/job record before mutating any downstream state.
- For non-persistent commands, persist a short-lived server-side dispatch record keyed by `commandId`, expected agent/device, and allowed target IDs, then reject result submissions that do not match that record.
- For discovery, backup, and restore jobs, record the dispatched `agentId` and require it to match on result submission.

Mitigation:
- Treat agent WebSocket connections as untrusted clients even after authentication and reject any result payload fields that attempt to select a different device or monitor than the one already bound server-side.

False positive notes:
- This finding assumes an authenticated agent can send arbitrary `command_result` messages over its WebSocket, which is exactly what the current message handler accepts.

### F-006: `runAs` helper execution returns unsanitized stdout/stderr, bypassing the normal secret-redaction path
Rule ID: GO-CONFIG-001
Severity: Medium
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_script.go:75](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_script.go:75)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_script.go:241](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_script.go:241)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go:530](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go:530)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go:597](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go:597)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/heartbeat.go:2628](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/heartbeat.go:2628)

Evidence:
- Local script execution sanitizes output before returning it: `executor.SanitizeOutput(scriptResult.Stdout/Stderr)`.
- The `runAs` helper path unmarshals nested helper results and assigns raw `stdout` and `stderr` directly to `cmdResult`.
- The helper itself serializes raw `result.Stdout` / `result.Stderr` for scripts and raw `stdout.String()` / `stderr.String()` for direct `"exec"` commands.
- The patching `makeUserExecFunc()` path also reads those helper fields back without any redaction.

Impact:
- Secrets echoed by helper-executed scripts or direct user-context commands can leak back into API responses, audit/result storage, worker jobs, or logs even though the direct execution path already attempts to redact common credential patterns.

Fix:
- Apply the same output sanitation to helper-returned script and exec results before they leave the helper, or sanitize again at the broker boundary before storing or returning them.
- Keep the redaction behavior centralized so direct and helper-mediated execution cannot drift again.

Mitigation:
- Avoid printing secrets from scripts, but do not rely on script hygiene alone because the direct executor already assumes redaction is necessary.

False positive notes:
- This is an output-handling inconsistency, not proof that a specific secret has already leaked.

### F-007: User-helper scopes are assigned during IPC auth but never enforced inside command dispatch
Rule ID: GO-AUTHZ-002
Severity: Low
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go:192](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go:192)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go:357](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go:357)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go:40](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go:40)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go:630](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go:630)

Evidence:
- The helper stores `authResp.AllowedScopes` in `c.scopes`.
- `c.scopes` is not referenced anywhere else in the helper.
- `handleCommand()` dispatches screenshot/computer-action, direct `"exec"`, and default script execution for any authenticated `ipc.TypeCommand` without checking whether the current helper role or scope permits that specific command.
- The broker does assign different scope sets for system helpers and user helpers, but the callee trusts the broker to always route correctly.

Impact:
- This weakens privilege separation between helper roles. A routing bug, future call-site mistake, or compromised broker-side caller can make a helper execute commands outside the role boundaries the auth handshake appears to establish.

Fix:
- Enforce command-to-scope mapping inside the helper before dispatch, for example requiring `run_as_user` for script/exec, `notify` for user notifications, and explicit desktop/capture scopes for screenshot or computer-action operations.
- Fail closed for unknown command types instead of treating the helper as implicitly authorized for every `ipc.TypeCommand`.

Mitigation:
- Keep broker-side scope filtering, but treat helper-side checks as a required second boundary rather than optional defense-in-depth.

False positive notes:
- The current broker generally routes commands by role already. The issue is that the helper does not independently enforce the contract it just authenticated.

Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/monitors.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/monitors.ts)

Summary:
- Monitor listing, dashboard, detail, results, and alert-rule reads now require `devices:read`.
- Monitor and alert-rule create/update/delete now require `devices:write` plus MFA.
- Active check and test routes now require `devices:execute` plus MFA.

### R-035: Audit-log routes now require dedicated audit permissions, with MFA on export
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/auditLogs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/auditLogs.ts)

Summary:
- Audit-log list, detail, search, report, and stats routes now require `audit:read`.
- Audit-log export routes now require `audit:export` plus MFA.

### R-036: DR plan and execution routes now require explicit device RBAC, with MFA on mutation and execution control
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/dr.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/dr.ts)

Summary:
- DR plan and execution reads now require `devices:read`.
- DR plan and group mutation now require `devices:write` plus MFA.
- DR execution start and abort now require `devices:execute` plus MFA.

### R-037: Global search now filters results by the caller's per-resource permissions
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/search.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/search.ts)

Summary:
- Device, script, and alert search queries now run only when the caller holds the corresponding `devices:read`, `scripts:read`, or `alerts:read` permission.
- The user-management settings entry is now hidden unless the caller has `users:read`.

### R-038: System config-status now requires explicit org read permission
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/system.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/system.ts)

Summary:
- The partner/system-only config-status route now additionally requires `organizations:read`.
- The harmless version route and the self-service setup-complete route remain authenticated but intentionally self-scoped.

### R-039: Agent WebSocket result routing now binds persistent results to the dispatched agent and expected target
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts)

Summary:
- SNMP and monitor orphaned results now require a cached server-side expectation bound to the dispatching agent and target resource before downstream state is updated.
- Discovery UUID job results now reject submissions from agents other than the agent assigned to the discovery job.

### R-040: Remote desktop file-drop now uses a private receive directory and fail-closed file creation semantics
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/filedrop/handler.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/filedrop/handler.go)

Summary:
- Viewer-uploaded files now land in a dedicated private receive directory instead of the global temp directory.
- Incoming files are created with exclusive `0600` permissions, duplicate transfer IDs are rejected, chunk payloads are size-limited, incomplete transfers are discarded, and in-progress partial files are removed on session cleanup.

### R-041: Remote desktop clipboard sync now enforces payload size bounds before decode and apply
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/clipboard/sync.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/clipboard/sync.go)

Summary:
- Clipboard messages are now rejected when the JSON envelope or decoded text/RTF/image content exceeds explicit size limits.
- The same size limits also apply on send, which prevents large local clipboard content from being mirrored into the remote session without bounds.

### R-042: Remote desktop input and control channels now reject oversized viewer messages
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/desktop/session_control.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/desktop/session_control.go)

Summary:
- Input-event messages and control-channel messages now fail closed when the JSON payload exceeds small protocol-appropriate limits.
- This removes an easy memory and log-amplification DoS path from the viewer-to-agent WebRTC control plane.

### R-043: Clipboard size limits now apply consistently across WebRTC sync, service proxying, and helper IPC
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/clipboard/clipboard.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/clipboard/clipboard.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/clipboard/clipboard_proxy.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/clipboard/clipboard_proxy.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go)

Summary:
- The clipboard size policy is now centralized and enforced before oversized clipboard content crosses the service/helper IPC boundary in either direction.
- This closes the gap where the WebRTC clipboard path was bounded but helper-mediated clipboard reads and writes were still trusting larger payloads.

### R-044: Desktop capture proxy now validates helper-reported frame dimensions with overflow-safe arithmetic
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/desktop/capture_proxy.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/desktop/capture_proxy.go)

Summary:
- Helper-reported capture dimensions are now validated using pre-multiplication overflow checks before computing expected RGBA buffer size.
- This removes reliance on platform integer-overflow behavior when rejecting malformed or corrupted helper capture responses.

### R-045: File listing now streams directory entries with an explicit cap instead of materializing entire directories
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/fileops.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/fileops.go)

Summary:
- `file_list` now reads directory entries incrementally and caps the returned entry count, marking responses as truncated when the directory exceeds the limit.
- This removes an easy memory and latency DoS path where a caller could force the agent to fully enumerate and allocate very large directories in one response.

### R-046: Terminal write operations now reject oversized input payloads
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/terminal.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/terminal.go)

Summary:
- `terminal_data` now enforces a maximum input size before writing to the PTY/session.
- This reduces the risk of oversized IPC/UI payloads being used to flood terminal sessions or force large transient allocations in the terminal tool wrapper.

### R-047: Terminal size handling now clamps caller-supplied dimensions before PTY operations
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/terminal.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/terminal.go)

Summary:
- `terminal_start` and `terminal_resize` now normalize `cols` and `rows` into sensible bounds before converting them to `uint16`.
- This removes wraparound behavior where negative or extreme caller input could turn into nonsensical PTY sizes after integer conversion.

### R-048: File writes now enforce an explicit payload-size limit, including base64 pre-decode checks
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/fileops.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/fileops.go)

Summary:
- `file_write` now rejects oversized text and base64 payloads before decoding or writing them to disk.
- This aligns write behavior with the existing read-size discipline and reduces the risk of using the file-write tool as a large-payload memory or disk-pressure primitive.

### R-049: Filesystem-analysis resume state now caps checkpoint and target-directory fan-out
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/filesystem_analysis.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/filesystem_analysis.go)

Summary:
- Filesystem-analysis checkpoint output is now capped to a bounded number of pending directories, and checkpoint/target-directory input is similarly capped on ingest.
- This reduces the chance that resume-state bookkeeping dominates the IPC payload or becomes a caller-controlled amplification vector during partial scans.

### R-050: Sessionbroker now enforces expected response types for pending helper commands
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/session.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/session.go)

Summary:
- Pending helper commands now track the response type they expect, and mismatched response types are dropped instead of satisfying the request by command ID alone.
- This tightens the helper IPC trust boundary so an unexpected helper message cannot complete the wrong pending operation just by reusing the same ID.

### R-051: Sensitive-data scan now caps include/exclude/suppress path fan-out in caller-provided scope
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/sensitive_data_scan.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/sensitive_data_scan.go)

Summary:
- Caller-provided include, exclude, and suppress path lists are now bounded before they are normalized into scan scope.
- This reduces payload amplification and keeps path-heavy scope configuration from dominating scan setup work.

### R-052: Sensitive-data scan now caps caller-controlled file-type, rule-toggle, and pattern-suppression sets
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/sensitive_data_scan.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/sensitive_data_scan.go)

Summary:
- File-type filters, rule toggles, and explicit pattern suppressions are now bounded when building the effective scan configuration.
- This keeps the user-controlled configuration surface proportional to the small fixed pattern catalog the scanner actually supports.

### R-053: Sensitive-data scan now bounds suppression regex compilation by count and pattern length
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/sensitive_data_scan.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/sensitive_data_scan.go)

Summary:
- Suppression regex lists are now capped, and oversized regex patterns are ignored before compilation.
- This reduces the risk of handing the scanner an arbitrarily large regex-compilation workload through scope configuration alone.

### R-054: Screenshot responses now fail closed when encoded output still exceeds the intended size budget
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/screenshot.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/screenshot.go)

Summary:
- After re-encoding at lower quality, screenshots are now rejected if the base64 payload still exceeds the response budget instead of silently returning an oversized payload.
- This keeps screenshot transport behavior aligned with the rest of the tool-layer result-size hardening.

### R-055: Event-log PowerShell filters now escape caller-controlled strings before command construction
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/eventlogs_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/eventlogs_windows.go)

Summary:
- Event-log queries and entry lookups now escape caller-controlled log names and provider names before embedding them into single-quoted PowerShell filter strings.
- This removes a straightforward PowerShell command-injection path where an attacker-controlled quote could break out of the intended filter expression.

### R-056: Event-log queries now cap caller-controlled pagination and truncate oversized event fields
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/eventlogs.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/eventlogs.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/eventlogs_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/eventlogs_windows.go)

Summary:
- Event-log query page depth is now capped before it can inflate the `page * limit` PowerShell fetch window.
- Event-log list/query responses now also truncate oversized log names, sources, and message bodies and surface a `truncated` flag in the response payload.

### R-057: Registry enumeration now caps subkey and value counts per response
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/registry_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/registry_windows.go)

Summary:
- Registry key and value listing now uses bounded enumeration calls instead of unbounded `ReadSubKeyNames(-1)` and `ReadValueNames(-1)`.
- Responses now expose truncation explicitly, which prevents registry-heavy paths from using unbounded enumeration as a memory and JSON amplification primitive.

### R-058: Registry value reads now fail closed on oversized raw values and omit oversized entries from list payloads
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/registry_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/registry_windows.go)

Summary:
- Single-value reads now reject registry blobs above the configured size budget instead of allocating arbitrarily large buffers.
- Value listings now replace oversized data with a bounded placeholder and truncate long rendered string payloads before marshalling them into tool output.

### R-059: Scheduled-task list, detail, and history responses now enforce count and field-size bounds
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/tasks_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/tasks_windows.go)

Summary:
- Scheduled-task listing now limits the PowerShell task enumeration itself before the agent parses the output, instead of always materializing the full task set.
- Task detail/history responses now truncate oversized names, descriptions, action paths/arguments, trigger schedules, and history messages, and list responses expose a `truncated` flag.

### R-060: Process list and detail responses now truncate oversized command lines and other caller-visible fields
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/processes.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/processes.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/result_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/result_limits.go)

Summary:
- Process list responses now sanitize process names, users, statuses, and command lines before marshalling them into tool output.
- Single-process detail responses now apply the same bounds, which prevents unusually large command lines from becoming an unbounded response payload.

### R-061: Service list and detail responses now enforce count and field-size bounds
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/services.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/services.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/result_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/result_limits.go)

Summary:
- Service lists are now capped to a bounded number of entries and expose a `truncated` flag when the result set exceeds that cap.
- Service names, accounts, executable paths, and descriptions are now truncated before being serialized, reducing the chance that a pathological service definition dominates the response payload.

### R-062: Service search and action routes now bound caller-controlled identifier strings before use
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/services.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/services.go)

Summary:
- Caller-controlled `search`, `status`, and `name` values are now truncated to a small bounded size before they are used for filtering or passed to OS-specific service handlers.
- This keeps service-management request costs proportional and avoids handing very large opaque identifiers down into platform-specific process invocation paths.

### R-063: Computer-action input now rejects oversized typed text, key names, and modifier lists
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/computer_action.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/computer_action.go)

Summary:
- `computer_action` now validates the size of `text`, `key`, and `modifiers` before replaying input events on the endpoint.
- This removes an easy way to turn the tool into a very large keystroke-replay and allocation primitive by submitting oversized strings or modifier arrays.

### R-064: Software install now requires HTTPS and bounds installer inputs and output logs
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/result_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/result_limits.go)

Summary:
- Software install downloads now require HTTPS rather than allowing cleartext HTTP transport for installer binaries.
- Installer metadata, silent-install arguments, and captured installer output are now bounded before execution and response serialization, with oversized logs truncated and flagged.

### R-065: Software install now validates redirect targets instead of trusting the default HTTP redirect chain
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go)

Summary:
- The installer download path now uses an explicit redirect policy that revalidates every redirect target and blocks downgrades away from HTTPS.
- This closes the gap where an initially valid HTTPS URL could still redirect the agent onto an insecure or malformed final download URL.

### R-066: Software install now rejects unsupported file types before downloading arbitrary files to disk
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go)

Summary:
- The install path now allowlists the supported installer types (`exe`, `msi`, `deb`, `pkg`, `dmg`) during input validation.
- This prevents the agent from downloading arbitrary unsupported payloads only to reject them later at execution time.

### R-067: Software install now validates checksum format before using it as an integrity control
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go)

Summary:
- Caller-provided checksums must now be valid 64-character SHA-256 hex strings before the agent accepts them as an integrity assertion.
- This tightens the install contract and avoids treating malformed checksum input as if it were a meaningful verification value.

### R-068: Software uninstall now rejects option-like package names and versions before invoking native package managers
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software.go)

Summary:
- Software uninstall now rejects names and versions that begin with `-`, in addition to the earlier unsafe-character checks.
- This closes an argument-injection path where option-like values could be forwarded into `apt-get`, `pacman`, `brew`, or similar native uninstall commands as unintended flags.

### R-069: Software uninstall now truncates command output and caps the aggregated error summary
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/result_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/result_limits.go)

Summary:
- Uninstall attempts now truncate large package-manager output before it is reflected back into the tool error path, and the final joined error summary is also bounded.
- This prevents uninstall failures from becoming another unbounded stdout/stderr amplification surface when package managers emit very large error text.

### R-070: Software install now requires the declared file type to match the provided filename extension
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go)

Summary:
- Install requests now validate that `fileName` ends in the extension implied by `fileType` before downloading or executing the payload.
- This tightens the install contract and prevents mismatched metadata from steering the execution path in surprising ways.

### R-071: Software install now rejects malformed silent-install argument strings before execution
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go)

Summary:
- `silentInstallArgs` now rejects control characters and unmatched quotes before it reaches the simplistic local argument splitter.
- This reduces the risk of malformed argument strings being interpreted unpredictably by the installer wrapper.

### R-072: MSI installation now always executes `msiexec` directly instead of letting arguments choose the binary
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go)

Summary:
- The MSI code path now always launches `msiexec` and builds its argument list separately, even if the caller supplied a string starting with `msiexec`.
- This closes a command-selection gap where the caller-controlled argument string could previously influence which executable the agent launched on the endpoint.

### R-073: Linux delayed agent restart no longer relies on a shell wrapper
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/agent_restart_linux.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/agent_restart_linux.go)

Summary:
- The Linux delayed restart helper now uses `systemd-run --on-active=3 -- systemctl restart ...` directly instead of spawning `bash -c`.
- This removes unnecessary shell indirection from the agent-restart path and narrows the execution surface to explicit command arguments.

### R-074: Windows delayed agent restart now uses a more constrained PowerShell invocation
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/agent_restart_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/agent_restart_windows.go)

Summary:
- The Windows delayed restart helper now runs PowerShell in `-NonInteractive` mode and targets the service explicitly with `Restart-Service -Name`.
- This keeps the remaining scripted restart helper tighter and less dependent on interactive shell behavior.

### R-075: Drive-list responses now enforce entry and field-size bounds
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/result_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/result_limits.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/drives_other.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/drives_other.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/drives_darwin.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/drives_darwin.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/drives_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/drives_windows.go)

Summary:
- Drive enumeration responses now cap the number of reported drives and truncate oversized mount points, labels, filesystem names, and drive-type strings.
- This keeps pathological mount metadata from turning the drive-list tool into another oversized JSON response surface.

### R-076: Linux service-list parsing now uses bounded scanners and fails closed on parse errors
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/services_linux.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/services_linux.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/result_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/result_limits.go)

Summary:
- The Linux `systemctl list-units` parser now uses an explicit scanner buffer budget and returns an error if parsing fails instead of silently truncating the result set.
- This removes a parser-failure blind spot where one oversized line could stop scanning without the caller learning that the list was incomplete.

### R-077: Linux `systemctl show` property parsing now reports scanner failures instead of silently dropping fields
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/services_linux.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/services_linux.go)

Summary:
- `parseSystemctlProperties` now returns an error on scanner failure, and `getServiceOS` propagates that failure to the caller.
- This makes the service-detail path fail closed when unexpectedly large or malformed `systemctl` output breaks parsing.

### R-078: macOS `launchctl list` parsing now uses bounded scanners and reports parse failures
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/services_darwin.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/services_darwin.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/result_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/result_limits.go)

Summary:
- The macOS service-list parser now uses the same bounded scanner policy and returns an explicit parse error instead of silently returning a partial list.
- This closes the same scanner-limit blind spot on the `launchctl` path.

### R-079: MSI install arguments now reject uninstall, repair, and administrative-action switches
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/software_install.go)

Summary:
- MSI install requests now reject action switches such as `/x`, `/uninstall`, `/a`, and `/f` in `silentInstallArgs`.
- This prevents the install endpoint from being repurposed into an MSI uninstall, repair, or administrative-image action by caller-controlled arguments.

### R-080: macOS delayed agent restart no longer depends on a shell wrapper
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/agent_restart.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/agent_restart.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/agent_restart_darwin.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/agent_restart_darwin.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/cmd/breeze-agent/internal_restart_cmd.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/cmd/breeze-agent/internal_restart_cmd.go)

Summary:
- The macOS delayed restart path now spawns a detached hidden helper subcommand from the current binary instead of using `bash -c "sleep ... && launchctl ..."`.
- This removes the last shell wrapper from the agent-restart path while preserving the delayed restart behavior needed to flush the command response before the service restarts.

### R-081: helper notifications now bound title, body, and icon sizes before invoking OS-specific notifiers
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/notify_common.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/notify_common.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/notify_linux.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/notify_linux.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/notify_darwin.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/notify_darwin.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/notify_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/notify_windows.go)

Summary:
- Notification requests are now normalized through a shared sanitizer that trims and caps the title, body, and icon fields before they are passed to `notify-send`, `osascript`, or PowerShell.
- This reduces argv and script-injection pressure from oversized caller-controlled notification payloads.

### R-082: helper notifications now cap action counts and normalize urgency values
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/notify_common.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/notify_common.go)

Summary:
- Notification actions are now capped to a small fixed count, and urgency is normalized to an allowlist of `low`, `normal`, or `critical`.
- This prevents unsupported or attacker-influenced notification metadata from becoming another loosely validated execution surface inside helper-side OS integrations.

### R-083: Windows toast notifications now run PowerShell in non-interactive mode
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/notify_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/notify_windows.go)

Summary:
- The Windows notification helper now invokes PowerShell with `-NonInteractive` in addition to `-NoProfile`.
- This keeps the toast path more constrained and avoids depending on interactive shell behavior for a background helper operation.

### R-084: service-control commands now reject malformed service identifiers before invoking native service managers
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/services.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/services.go)

Summary:
- `get/start/stop/restart service` now reject identifiers with traversal markers, path separators, whitespace-padding, or control characters instead of truncating and forwarding them into `systemctl` or `launchctl`.
- This tightens the service-control surface and prevents malformed names from steering service-manager lookups in surprising ways.

### R-085: scheduled-task operations now validate task folders and task paths before use
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/tasks.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/tasks.go)

Summary:
- Scheduled-task commands now require canonical `\\...` task paths/folders and reject traversal markers and control characters before they reach the Windows task wrappers.
- This narrows the task-control input boundary instead of trusting raw caller-provided identifiers throughout the task toolchain.

### R-086: trash listings now cap the number of returned items and expose truncation explicitly
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/fileops.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/fileops.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/types.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/types.go)

Summary:
- `file_trash_list` now caps the number of returned items and marks the response as `truncated` when the trash contains more entries than the transport budget should return.
- This prevents a large trash directory from turning the file-ops response into another unbounded JSON amplification surface.

### R-087: trash metadata reads now enforce a size budget before list, restore, or lazy-purge parsing
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/fileops.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/fileops.go)

Summary:
- Trash metadata files are now size-checked before `json.Unmarshal` in list, restore, and lazy-purge flows.
- This closes a remaining local DoS path where a corrupted or oversized metadata file could force unnecessary memory allocation during routine trash operations.

### R-088: trash purge now caps the number of returned per-item error strings
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/fileops.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/remote/tools/fileops.go)

Summary:
- `file_trash_purge` now limits how many per-item error strings are accumulated into the response payload.
- This keeps purge failures from reflecting unbounded error arrays back through the remote tool channel when the trash contains many failing entries.

### R-089: broker self-hash computation now streams the agent binary instead of reading it fully into memory
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go)

Summary:
- The session broker now hashes its own executable through a streaming SHA-256 helper after verifying that the path is a regular file.
- This removes an avoidable whole-file memory read from the helper-integrity path and makes the broker more resilient to unexpectedly large binaries.

### R-090: Linux session detection now runs `loginctl` enumeration under explicit command timeouts
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_linux.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_linux.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go)

Summary:
- The Linux detector now executes both `loginctl list-sessions` and per-session `loginctl show-session` calls through bounded `CommandContext` timeouts.
- This prevents a hung session-enumeration subprocess from stalling the detector loop indefinitely.

### R-091: Linux session detection now uses bounded scanners and reports parser failures instead of silently truncating state
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_linux.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_linux.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go)

Summary:
- The Linux detector now parses `loginctl` output with an explicit scanner buffer budget and returns errors on scanner failure instead of silently accepting partial output.
- This removes another oversized-output blind spot from a trust boundary that feeds helper-spawning and session-targeting logic.

### R-092: detected-session snapshots now validate field contents and cap total session fan-out
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_linux.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_linux.go)

Summary:
- Detected session usernames, session IDs, display names, seat names, and state/type fields now pass through a shared validator, and the detector caps the number of returned sessions.
- This prevents malformed or oversized session metadata from flowing unchecked into the broker’s session-selection logic.

### R-093: macOS no-CGO session detection now uses timed subprocesses for console user and UID lookup
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_darwin_nocgo.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_darwin_nocgo.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go)

Summary:
- The macOS fallback detector now runs `stat` and `id -u` with explicit timeouts instead of untimed child processes.
- This keeps the no-CGO detector from hanging indefinitely when the local command path misbehaves.

### R-094: macOS no-CGO session detection now validates the console username and normalizes the returned session shape
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_darwin_nocgo.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_darwin_nocgo.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go)

Summary:
- The fallback detector now validates the console username, parses the UID with `strconv`, and returns a sanitized `DetectedSession` with an explicit `console` type.
- This tightens the contract on the darwin no-CGO path instead of trusting raw command output as already well-formed.

### R-095: the broker now drops unmatched response-only helper messages instead of forwarding them into higher layers
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go)

Summary:
- Unmatched `command_result`, `notify_result`, and `clipboard_data` envelopes are now explicitly dropped rather than forwarded to the heartbeat as unsolicited helper messages.
- This narrows the broker’s message surface and removes a class of stray or spoofed response packets that had no legitimate unsolicited consumer.

### R-096: the broker now enforces scope checks on unsolicited tray, desktop, and backup helper messages
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go)

Summary:
- The broker now requires the relevant helper scope before forwarding unsolicited `tray_action`, `sas_request`, `desktop_peer_disconnected`, and backup progress/result messages.
- This makes the unsolicited IPC path fail closed if a helper tries to emit message families outside the role it authenticated for.

### R-097: the macOS TCC dialog path now uses escaped AppleScript strings and bounded command execution
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/tcc_darwin.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/tcc_darwin.go)

Summary:
- The TCC dialog path now feeds its message text through the existing AppleScript string escaper and runs `osascript` under an explicit timeout.
- This keeps the consent prompt path tighter and avoids indefinite blocking on a GUI scripting subprocess.

### R-098: the macOS TCC System Settings opener now uses an allowlisted permission-to-URL mapper and bounded `open` execution
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/tcc_common.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/tcc_common.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/tcc_darwin.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/tcc_darwin.go)

Summary:
- Opening System Settings now goes through a small allowlisted permission-to-URL mapper and invokes `open` under a bounded timeout.
- This removes any chance of the TCC helper path turning arbitrary permission labels into unchecked URL launches.

### R-099: the user-helper self-integrity hash now streams executable bytes instead of reading the whole binary into memory
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go)

Summary:
- The user helper now computes its self-hash through a streaming SHA-256 helper instead of reading the full executable into memory before hashing.
- This aligns the helper-side integrity check with the broker-side hardening and removes another avoidable whole-file read from the auth path.

### R-100: the CGO macOS session detector now sanitizes the console snapshot before returning it
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_darwin.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_darwin.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go)

Summary:
- The CGO-backed macOS detector now runs the console user snapshot through the same shared detected-session validator used by the hardened Linux and no-CGO darwin paths.
- This brings the last darwin detector variant up to the same field-validation standard before session metadata reaches helper lifecycle decisions.

### R-101: the CGO macOS session watch loop now normalizes console-user transitions instead of trusting raw C strings
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_darwin.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_darwin.go)

Summary:
- The watch loop now sanitizes both initial and current console-user snapshots before emitting login/logout events.
- This keeps malformed or unexpected console-user values from bypassing the detected-session validation path during live transition handling.

### R-102: Windows session detection now caps the number of enumerated sessions returned to the broker
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_windows.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go)

Summary:
- The Windows detector now stops after a bounded number of sanitized session entries instead of reflecting arbitrarily large WTS enumerations.
- This keeps the Windows session snapshot surface aligned with the same result-budget policy used on other detector implementations.

### R-103: Windows detected-session fields now pass through shared normalization before entering broker state
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_windows.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_common.go)

Summary:
- Windows session IDs, display names, states, types, and usernames are now validated and size-bounded before they are appended to the detected-session list.
- This closes the last cross-platform gap where detector output was still treated as implicitly trustworthy on one platform.

### R-104: Windows session IDs now use a strict shared parser instead of loose `%d` parsing
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/windows_session_id.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/windows_session_id.go)

Summary:
- Windows session identifiers now have a dedicated parser that rejects whitespace, non-digits, negative values, and oversized inputs.
- This avoids the lenient `%d` parsing behavior that could previously accept malformed session strings in downstream Windows-session control paths.

### R-105: disconnect-state checks now fail closed on malformed Windows session IDs
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/detector_windows.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/windows_session_id.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/windows_session_id.go)

Summary:
- `IsSessionDisconnected` now uses the strict Windows session-ID parser before issuing the WTS query.
- This removes another loose parsing path from a helper-targeting decision that determines whether a session is safe to reuse for capture.

### R-106: `list_sessions` now skips malformed session identifiers instead of silently coercing them to session `0`
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/windows_session_id.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/windows_session_id.go)

Summary:
- The heartbeat-side `list_sessions` response builder now parses session IDs strictly and drops malformed entries rather than letting `fmt.Sscanf` default them to zero.
- This prevents corrupted detector output from being misreported as the privileged services session in API-facing session listings.

### R-107: helper spawning now validates explicit target Windows session IDs before invoking the spawner
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop_helper.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop_helper.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/windows_session_id.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/windows_session_id.go)

Summary:
- The desktop-helper spawn path now validates `targetSession` with the strict session-ID parser before converting it to the numeric session handle used by the Windows spawner.
- This narrows a remaining trust boundary where caller-influenced session strings still flowed into session-targeted helper creation.

### R-108: helper-originated desktop-disconnect notices now require a valid session ID format before they affect API state
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/heartbeat.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/heartbeat.go)

Summary:
- Desktop peer-disconnect notices are now checked against a bounded session-ID pattern before the heartbeat forwards them toward the API.
- This prevents malformed helper-originated session identifiers from mutating remote-session state or log streams.

### R-109: helper-originated desktop-disconnect notices are now bound to the recorded owning helper session
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/heartbeat.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/heartbeat.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop_helper.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop_helper.go)

Summary:
- The heartbeat now verifies that a desktop peer-disconnect notice came from the helper session recorded as that desktop session’s owner before forwarding it.
- This closes a cross-session tampering path where one connected desktop-capable helper could previously try to mark another session’s viewer as disconnected.

### R-110: desktop-disconnect notifications sent upstream now refuse invalid session IDs, even if called internally
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/heartbeat.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/heartbeat.go)

Summary:
- The outbound `sendDesktopDisconnectNotification` helper now independently validates the session ID before constructing the WebSocket result.
- This adds a second fail-closed guard on the API-facing path rather than relying only on the caller to have validated the identifier already.

### R-111: macOS GUI-user discovery now uses bounded scanning and validates discovered UIDs before LaunchAgent restart attempts
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop_helper.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop_helper.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/windows_session_id.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/windows_session_id.go)

Summary:
- The macOS `ps` output parser used for GUI-user discovery now uses a bounded scanner, de-duplicates results, caps the number of discovered UIDs, and rejects malformed numeric IDs.
- This hardens the LaunchAgent kickstart/bootstrap helper path against oversized process listings and malformed UID tokens.

### R-112: `start_desktop` now rejects malformed desktop session identifiers before opening a new session
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go)

Summary:
- The heartbeat-side `start_desktop` handler now validates the caller-supplied session identifier against the same bounded desktop-session pattern already used on disconnect notifications.
- This prevents malformed or path-like session IDs from entering desktop session creation and downstream owner-tracking state.

### R-113: stop, stream, input, and config desktop commands now share the same fail-closed session-ID validation
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go)

Summary:
- `stop_desktop`, `desktop_stream_start`, `desktop_stream_stop`, `desktop_input`, and `desktop_config` now all go through a shared validated-session-ID helper instead of accepting arbitrary caller strings.
- This closes the remaining heartbeat-side command paths that still trusted raw desktop session identifiers after the earlier disconnect/owner hardening.

### R-114: desktop start requests now bound `displayIndex` to a small integer range
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go)

Summary:
- The desktop start path now requires `displayIndex` to be an integer between `0` and `16`.
- This prevents malformed floating-point or extreme display indices from flowing into session creation and monitor-selection logic.

### R-115: WebSocket desktop stream start now enforces the same bounded monitor index policy
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go)

Summary:
- `desktop_stream_start` now applies the same integer-and-range validation to `displayIndex` before it reaches the WS desktop manager.
- This keeps the stream-start path aligned with the direct desktop-start path rather than leaving one monitor-selection surface looser than the other.

### R-116: desktop input events now use an explicit allowlist of supported event types
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go)

Summary:
- Heartbeat-side desktop input parsing now rejects unknown `type` values instead of passing arbitrary strings into the platform-specific input handlers.
- This removes another trust boundary where malformed or unexpected viewer event types still reached desktop control code.

### R-117: mouse-button desktop input is now canonicalized to a strict left/right/middle allowlist
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go)

Summary:
- Desktop input normalization now only accepts `left`, `right`, or `middle` mouse-button identifiers and defaults blank click/down/up events to `left`.
- This prevents unexpected button tokens from flowing into platform-specific click injection code.

### R-118: keyboard desktop input now normalizes and size-bounds key and modifier fields
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go)

Summary:
- Keyboard events now require a bounded `key`, de-duplicate modifiers, cap modifier count, and canonicalize aliases like `control`, `cmd`, `super`, and `win`.
- This reduces injection ambiguity and avoids unbounded or adversarial modifier payloads in the input path.

### R-119: desktop input coordinates and scroll deltas now reject malformed or extreme numeric values
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_desktop.go)

Summary:
- Input normalization now requires integer coordinates, rejects `NaN`/`Inf`, and caps coordinate magnitude and scroll delta before the desktop manager sees the event.
- This removes a simple agent-side denial-of-service path where oversized scroll counts or malformed numeric payloads could reach input-injection loops.

### R-120: helper install and migration shell-outs now run under a shared timeout wrapper instead of unconstrained local process execution
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/command_util.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/command_util.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/install_linux.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/install_linux.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/install_darwin.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/install_darwin.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/install_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/install_windows.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/migrate_linux.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/migrate_linux.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/migrate_darwin.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/migrate_darwin.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/migrate_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/migrate_windows.go)

Summary:
- Helper lifecycle commands such as `pgrep`, `pkill`, `tasklist`, `taskkill`, `launchctl bootout`, `stat`, and `loginctl` now execute through a shared `CommandContext` timeout wrapper.
- This hardens a remaining cluster of local helper-management shell-outs that could otherwise hang indefinitely and stall install, removal, or migration flows.

### R-121: helper-side UID, process-path, and migration-target parsing now validates and bounds local command output before use
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/command_util.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/command_util.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/install_darwin.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/install_darwin.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/process_check_darwin.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/process_check_darwin.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/migrate_linux.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/helper/migrate_linux.go)

Summary:
- The helper package now parses console UIDs, process paths, and Linux migration targets through explicit numeric/path validators with bounded scanner limits and deduped target caps.
- This closes another local trust boundary where raw command output still flowed directly into helper-session selection or process-identity checks.

### R-122: package-manager providers now share bounded command-execution helpers instead of issuing unconstrained local shell-outs directly
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go)

Summary:
- The patching module now has shared timeout wrappers for output and combined-output command execution, plus a reusable bounded scanner configuration.
- This removes a broad class of hung local package-manager invocations from the patch scan/install/remove paths.

### R-123: package-manager install and uninstall output is now truncated before entering logs, errors, and result payloads
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/chocolatey.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/chocolatey.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/homebrew.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/homebrew.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/apt.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/apt.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/yum.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/yum.go)

Summary:
- Install/uninstall output returned from `brew`, `apt-get`, `dnf`/`yum`, and `choco` is now truncated to a bounded size before it is copied into errors or `InstallResult.Message`.
- This reduces a remaining agent-side memory and log-amplification path on package-manager failures.

### R-124: APT install and uninstall now validate package IDs before invoking `apt-get`
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/apt.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/apt.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go)

Summary:
- The APT provider now enforces an explicit allowlist for package names and rejects option-like or malformed identifiers before calling `apt-get`.
- This closes a shell-wrapper input boundary where caller-controlled package IDs were still treated as implicitly safe.

### R-125: YUM/DNF install and uninstall now enforce the same package-name validation before mutation
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/yum.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/yum.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go)

Summary:
- The YUM/DNF provider now validates patch identifiers before it calls `update` or `remove`.
- This removes the remaining unchecked package-name input on the Linux RPM patching path.

### R-126: Homebrew package IDs are now validated before formula or cask upgrade/removal commands are constructed
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/homebrew.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/homebrew.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go)

Summary:
- Homebrew install and uninstall now reject malformed names, option-like identifiers, path-like values, and traversal-style tokens before command construction.
- This narrows the package-ID trust boundary on the macOS third-party patch path.

### R-127: Chocolatey scan, install, uninstall, and installed-package enumeration now run under explicit timeouts
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/chocolatey.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/chocolatey.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go)

Summary:
- The Chocolatey provider no longer calls `choco` through unconstrained `Output`/`CombinedOutput` paths.
- This hardens the Windows package-manager wrapper against indefinitely hung local command execution during scan or mutation.

### R-128: APT scan and installed-package enumeration now use bounded scanning and timeout-wrapped command execution
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/apt.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/apt.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go)

Summary:
- The APT provider now parses `apt list --upgradable` and `dpkg-query` output through the shared bounded scanner and timeout wrapper.
- This reduces oversized local package-list output and hung command risk in the Debian/Ubuntu scan path.

### R-129: YUM/DNF scan and installed-package enumeration now use the same bounded scanner and timeout policy
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/yum.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/yum.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/patching/command_limits.go)

Summary:

- The `auditpol /r` CSV parser now streams rows instead of `ReadAll`, caps parsed row count, and truncates normalized keys/values before they enter settings state.
- This reduces memory pressure and reflected-string amplification in the Windows audit-policy parser.

### R-173: Windows audit baseline apply now uses bounded command execution and truncates reflected errors
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/collectors/audit_policy_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/collectors/audit_policy_windows.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/collectors/command_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/collectors/command_limits.go)

Summary:
- The Windows audit baseline apply path now executes `auditpol /set` under the shared combined-output budget and truncates reflected stderr/stdout when reporting failures.
- This narrows the remaining command-output reflection path in the Windows compliance mutator.

### R-174: Windows bandwidth and hardware inventory now use bounded PowerShell/WMIC execution and truncated returned values
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/collectors/bandwidth_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/collectors/bandwidth_windows.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/collectors/hardware_windows.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/collectors/hardware_windows.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/collectors/command_limits.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/collectors/command_limits.go)

Summary:
- Windows link-speed lookup now uses bounded non-interactive PowerShell execution, and WMIC-based hardware inventory now runs through the shared timeout helper and truncates returned values.
- This removes the last small direct command readers from the Windows bandwidth and hardware inventory paths.

### R-175: Helper-side launch-process requests now enforce path, argument-count, and control-character validation
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go)

Summary:
- The helper now validates `launch_process` requests before execution, rejecting oversized binary paths, oversized or excessive arguments, and arguments containing control characters.
- This tightens the helper IPC boundary so malformed or abuse-oriented launch requests fail closed before they reach OS process creation.

### R-176: Helper-side desktop start and stop requests now validate session identity and SDP/ICE payload size
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/client.go)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/desktop.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/userhelper/desktop.go)

Summary:
- Desktop helper requests now require a normalized session ID, cap SDP offer and ICE-server payload size, and bound allowed display indices before session startup or teardown.
- This closes another malformed-message and oversized-payload path in the desktop helper boundary.

### R-177: Broker now rebinds helper-reported capabilities to the authenticated helper session scopes
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go)

Summary:
- When a helper reports its capabilities, the broker now trims reflected metadata and masks capability booleans back down to the scopes granted during helper authentication.
- This prevents a compromised or buggy helper from self-advertising broader notify, tray, clipboard, or desktop authority than the broker session actually allows.

### R-178: Desktop session state transitions in agent WebSocket handling now bind to the exact start or disconnect command ID
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts)

Summary:
- Desktop answer, disconnect, and start-failure handling now derive the session ID from the exact `desk-start-...` or `desk-disconnect-...` command ID and only accept a payload session ID when it matches that expected value.
- This closes a cross-session trust gap where a crafted non-start desktop result or mismatched payload session ID could previously drive the state of another remote desktop session on the same device.

### R-179: Session broker command waits now validate payload-level correlation for helper command and desktop-start responses
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/session.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/session.go)

Summary:
- After matching a pending helper response by envelope ID and type, the session broker now also validates payload-level identifiers for `command_result` and `desktop_start` responses before delivering them to callers.
- This closes a remaining trust gap where a compromised helper could reuse the right envelope ID and type but smuggle a different command or desktop session identity inside the response payload.

### R-180: Agent command-result ingestion now only accepts in-flight device commands
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts)

Summary:
- Agent command results now resolve and update `device_commands` rows only when the command is still in an in-flight state (`pending` or `sent`), rather than accepting any historical command row for the device.
- This closes a replay/overwrite path where a connected agent could previously resubmit a result against an old command ID and mutate already-completed command state or its downstream post-processing records.

### R-181: Agent command-result post-processing now aborts when the in-flight status transition was lost and rebinds script execution updates to the resolved device
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts)

Summary:
- After conditionally updating a `device_commands` row from `pending`/`sent` to its terminal state, the agent WebSocket handler now aborts all downstream post-processing if that update affected no rows, rather than continuing on stale or concurrently-processed results.
- The script-result path now also updates `script_executions` only when the execution belongs to the resolved device and is still active, and only increments a batch counter when the batch matches the execution's script.
- This closes a race where a replayed or duplicated result could lose the command status update but still mutate discovery, backup, script, or other downstream records.

### R-182: Shared command delivery now claims `pending -> sent` before dispatch and releases failed claims
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/commandDispatch.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/commandDispatch.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/commandQueue.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/commandQueue.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agents/heartbeat.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agents/heartbeat.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/scripts.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/scripts.ts)

Summary:
- Row-backed commands are now conditionally claimed from `pending` to `sent` before WebSocket delivery or heartbeat handoff, and failed immediate deliveries release the claim back to `pending`.
- The agent WebSocket and heartbeat fetch paths now return only successfully claimed commands, and the immediate script dispatch path uses the same claim/release flow.
- This closes a duplicate-delivery race where concurrent WebSocket and heartbeat dispatch paths could otherwise hand the same pending command to an agent more than once.

### R-183: Generic queue timeout and result-submission helpers now only transition in-flight commands
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/commandQueue.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/commandQueue.ts)

Summary:
- `waitForCommandResult`, `markCommandsSent`, and `submitCommandResult` now condition their updates on the command still being in the expected in-flight state, instead of unconditionally overwriting any row with the matching ID.
- This closes the remaining stale-transition path in the generic command queue helpers and keeps replayed or late updates from mutating already-completed command rows.

### R-184: Backup result persistence now only finalizes in-flight backup jobs before writing snapshots or chain metadata
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/backupResultPersistence.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/backupResultPersistence.ts)

Summary:
- Backup result application now conditionally updates `backup_jobs` only while the job is still `pending` or `running`, and it aborts snapshot-file, MSSQL-chain, and GFS-retention persistence when that conditional state transition does not succeed.
- This closes a stale-result replay path where a duplicated or late backup result could previously overwrite an already-terminal job and still mutate secondary backup state such as snapshots and chains.

### R-185: All backup result consumers now use the same in-flight finalization guard for malformed, queued, and inline agent results
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/backup/mssql.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/backup/mssql.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/backup/hyperv.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/backup/hyperv.ts)

Summary:
- The Redis-inline backup result path, the queued backup worker result path, and the manual Hyper-V and MSSQL execution paths now all finalize or fail jobs through the shared conditional helper instead of issuing unconditional `backup_jobs` updates.
- This removes several inconsistent terminal-state writes and ensures malformed or replayed backup results fail closed once the job has already left its in-flight states.

### R-186: Backup BullMQ enqueue helpers now use stable logical job IDs
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/backupEnqueue.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/backupEnqueue.ts)

Summary:
- Backup dispatch, backup result processing, and restore dispatch queue submissions now set stable BullMQ `jobId` values derived from the logical backup or restore job ID.
- This closes a duplicate-enqueue path where repeated enqueue attempts for the same backup workflow could otherwise stack multiple identical queue jobs in Redis before the database-layer stale-result guards ran.

### R-187: Manual backup job creation now acquires a transaction-scoped per-device lock and refuses duplicate active jobs
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/backupJobCreation.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/backupJobCreation.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/backup/jobs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/backup/jobs.ts)

Summary:
- Manual backup job creation now runs under a transaction-scoped advisory lock keyed by organization and device, checks for existing `pending` or `running` jobs inside that locked transaction, and returns `409` instead of inserting a second active job.
- This closes a race where concurrent manual backup requests could both pass the old check-then-insert flow and create duplicate active jobs for the same device.

### R-188: Scheduled backup creation now uses occurrence-scoped locking before inserting minute-window jobs
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/backupJobCreation.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/backupJobCreation.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.ts)

Summary:
- Scheduled backup creation now acquires an advisory lock scoped to device, config/feature, and due occurrence key before checking the minute window and inserting the scheduled backup row.
- This closes the parallel scheduler race where concurrent schedule processors could previously both miss the minute-window row and create duplicate scheduled backup jobs for the same occurrence.

### R-189: Discovery job creation now acquires a transaction-scoped per-profile lock and reuses active jobs
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/discoveryJobCreation.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/discoveryJobCreation.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/discovery.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/discovery.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/discoveryWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/discoveryWorker.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/networkBaselineWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/networkBaselineWorker.ts)

Summary:
- Discovery job creation now runs under a transaction-scoped advisory lock keyed by organization and profile, checks for existing `scheduled` or `running` discovery jobs inside that lock, and reuses the active row instead of blindly inserting another one.
- Manual `/discovery/scan` now returns `409` when a profile already has an active job, scheduled profile runs skip duplicate creation, and baseline-triggered discovery scans reuse the existing discovery job ID.
- This closes a race where concurrent manual, scheduled, or baseline-triggered scans for the same profile could previously create duplicate active discovery jobs.

### R-190: Discovery and network-baseline queue submissions now use stable logical BullMQ job IDs
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/discoveryWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/discoveryWorker.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/networkBaselineWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/networkBaselineWorker.ts)

Summary:
- Discovery dispatch and result-processing queue submissions now use stable BullMQ job IDs derived from the discovery job ID, and network-baseline execute/compare queue submissions now use stable IDs derived from the baseline and discovery job IDs.
- This closes duplicate-enqueue paths where repeated submissions for the same discovery or baseline workflow could otherwise stack multiple identical queue jobs before the row-level state guards executed.

### R-191: Monitor result processing now deduplicates per monitor check command ID
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/monitorWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/monitorWorker.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts)

Summary:
- Monitor result ingestion now carries the originating `mon-...` command ID into the queued monitor result payload, and the monitor worker uses that command ID as a stable BullMQ `jobId` for `process-check-result`.
- This closes a duplicate post-processing path where repeated deliveries of the same monitor check result could otherwise enqueue and record the same logical check more than once.

### R-192: SNMP poll dispatch and result processing now use stable logical BullMQ job IDs
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/snmpWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/snmpWorker.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/agentWs.ts)

Summary:
- SNMP per-device poll jobs now use a stable queue `jobId` derived from the SNMP device ID, and queued SNMP result processing now uses the originating `snmp-...` command ID as a stable `jobId`.
- This closes duplicate dispatch and duplicate post-processing paths where repeated scheduler ticks or repeated agent deliveries for the same SNMP poll could otherwise queue the same logical work more than once.

### R-193: C2C sync job creation now acquires a transaction-scoped per-config lock and reuses active jobs
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/c2cJobCreation.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/c2cJobCreation.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/c2cBackupWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/c2cBackupWorker.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/c2c/jobs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/c2c/jobs.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/aiToolsC2C.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/aiToolsC2C.ts)

Summary:
- C2C sync creation now runs under a transaction-scoped advisory lock keyed by organization and backup configuration, checks for existing `pending` or `running` sync jobs inside that locked transaction, and reuses the active row instead of blindly inserting another one.
- Scheduled sync generation, manual `/c2c/configs/:id/run`, and the AI-triggered sync path now all share that helper, and the manual/API entrypoints now refuse duplicate active syncs instead of stacking them.
- This closes the same check-then-insert race that previously existed in backup and discovery, where concurrent schedule ticks or manual sync triggers for the same C2C configuration could create duplicate active jobs.

### R-194: C2C sync and restore queue submissions now use stable logical BullMQ job IDs
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/c2cEnqueue.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/c2cEnqueue.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/c2cBackupWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/c2cBackupWorker.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/c2c/items.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/routes/c2c/items.ts)
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/aiToolsC2C.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/services/aiToolsC2C.ts)

Summary:
- C2C sync dispatch and restore processing now flow through shared enqueue helpers that assign stable BullMQ `jobId` values derived from the logical C2C job ID and reuse still-active queue entries instead of submitting another copy.
- This closes duplicate-enqueue paths where repeated sync or restore submissions for the same C2C job could otherwise stack multiple identical BullMQ jobs and re-run the same logical work.

### R-195: Sensitive-data throttling requeues now preserve stable scan queue identity
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/sensitiveDataJobs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/sensitiveDataJobs.ts)

Summary:
- Sensitive-data scan dispatch now goes through a shared helper that reuses the stable BullMQ `jobId` derived from the logical scan ID and reuses an already active or delayed queue entry instead of blindly adding another dispatch job.
- The throttle/backpressure requeue path now uses that same helper, so repeated org-cap or device-cap throttling for the same scan cannot silently stack duplicate delayed dispatch jobs in Redis.

### R-196: Deployment-level queue jobs now use stable logical BullMQ identities
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/deploymentWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/deploymentWorker.ts)

Summary:
- Deployment start and staggered next-batch scheduling now use stable BullMQ `jobId` values derived from the logical deployment and batch, and they reuse still-active queue entries instead of blindly adding another copy.
- This closes duplicate-enqueue paths where repeated deployment starts or repeated batch scheduling for the same rollout phase could otherwise stack multiple identical deployment queue jobs.

### R-197: Deployment device dispatch and deferred requeues now deduplicate per deployment/device pair
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/deploymentWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/deploymentWorker.ts)

Summary:
- Deployment device dispatch now assigns stable queue identities per deployment/device pair, skips devices that already have an active or delayed queue entry, and uses a separate stable deferred identity for maintenance-window waits and retry backoff.
- This prevents repeated batch processing, retry scheduling, or maintenance-window deferrals from stacking duplicate device-execution jobs while still preserving the one future delayed run that the active worker intends to schedule.

### R-198: Patch job orchestration now uses stable logical BullMQ identities
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/patchJobExecutor.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/patchJobExecutor.ts)

Summary:
- Patch job enqueue, per-device execution fanout, and completion-check scheduling now use stable BullMQ `jobId` values derived from the logical patch job and device identities, and they reuse still-active queue entries instead of blindly adding another copy.
- This closes duplicate-enqueue paths where repeated scheduler or route submissions for the same patch job could otherwise stack duplicate orchestration, completion, or per-device execution jobs.

### R-199: Patch job execution now fail-closes on the `scheduled -> running` claim boundary
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/patchJobExecutor.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/patchJobExecutor.ts)

Summary:
- Patch job orchestration now transitions a job from `scheduled` to `running` with a conditional update that only succeeds while the row is still unclaimed, and the worker aborts fanout if that claim affected no rows.
- This closes the race where duplicate `execute-patch-job` queue entries could both observe a `scheduled` job and both fan out duplicate per-device patch installs before one of them noticed the state change.

### R-200: DR execution reconciliation now uses stable logical BullMQ identities
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/drExecutionWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/drExecutionWorker.ts)

Summary:
- DR execution reconciliation now uses a stable BullMQ `jobId` derived from the logical execution ID and reuses still-active or delayed queue entries instead of blindly adding another reconcile job.
- This closes duplicate-enqueue paths where repeated DR execution updates for the same failover, failback, or rehearsal record could otherwise stack redundant reconcile jobs in Redis.

### R-201: Browser policy evaluation requests now deduplicate by org and policy within a short queue window
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/browserSecurityJobs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/browserSecurityJobs.ts)

Summary:
- On-demand browser policy evaluation now assigns a stable BullMQ `jobId` derived from the organization, policy, and current short dedupe slot, and it reuses an already active or delayed queue entry instead of blindly adding another evaluation job.
- This closes a queue-amplification path where repeated route retries or policy edits for the same org/policy pair could otherwise stack duplicate full-extension evaluation work in Redis.

### R-202: Manual log correlation requests now deduplicate by logical detection parameters
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/logCorrelation.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/logCorrelation.ts)

Summary:
- Manual rules-based and ad hoc pattern-based log correlation requests now derive stable BullMQ `jobId` values from the normalized request parameters plus a short dedupe slot, and they reuse active queue entries instead of scheduling another copy.
- This closes a resource-amplification path where repeated correlation requests with the same parameters could otherwise stack duplicate expensive log-search jobs before the prior copy completed.

### R-203: User-risk recompute requests now deduplicate per organization within a short queue window
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/userRiskJobs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/userRiskJobs.ts)

Summary:
- On-demand user-risk recompute now assigns a stable BullMQ `jobId` derived from the target organization and the current short dedupe slot, and it reuses an already active queue entry instead of enqueueing another org-wide recomputation.
- This closes a queue-amplification path where repeated retries of the same recompute request could otherwise stack duplicate full-org risk scoring jobs.

### R-204: Manual alert evaluation requests now deduplicate by target and queue window
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/alertWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/alertWorker.ts)

Summary:
- On-demand device evaluation and full alert evaluation now assign stable BullMQ `jobId` values derived from the logical target plus a short dedupe slot, and they reuse already active queue entries instead of blindly enqueueing another scan.
- This closes a route-retry amplification path where repeated alert evaluation requests could otherwise stack duplicate alert-rule scans for the same device set.

### R-205: Security-posture recompute requests now deduplicate per organization within a short queue window
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/securityPostureWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/securityPostureWorker.ts)

Summary:
- On-demand security posture recompute now assigns a stable BullMQ `jobId` per organization and short dedupe slot, and it reuses an already active queue entry instead of scheduling another org-wide posture run.
- This closes a queue-amplification path where repeated retries could otherwise stack duplicate security posture recomputations for the same organization.

### R-206: Device reliability recompute requests now deduplicate per device within a short queue window
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/reliabilityWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/reliabilityWorker.ts)

Summary:
- On-demand device reliability recompute now assigns a stable BullMQ `jobId` derived from the device and short dedupe slot, and it reuses an already active queue entry instead of scheduling another copy.
- This closes a duplicate-enqueue path where repeated device reliability refreshes for the same device could otherwise stack redundant scoring work.

### R-207: Audit-baseline collection and drift-evaluation requests now deduplicate per organization within a short queue window
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/auditBaselineJobs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/auditBaselineJobs.ts)

Summary:
- Manual audit policy collection and drift evaluation now assign stable BullMQ `jobId` values derived from the target organization and short dedupe slot, and they reuse already active queue entries instead of blindly adding another scan.
- This closes duplicate-enqueue paths where repeated audit-baseline requests could otherwise stack redundant collection and evaluation jobs for the same org.

### R-208: Manual CIS scans now deduplicate by baseline, normalized device set, and queue window
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/cisJobs.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/cisJobs.ts)

Summary:
- Manual CIS scan requests now normalize and sort the requested device set, derive a stable BullMQ `jobId` from the baseline, normalized target set, and short dedupe slot, and reuse already active queue entries instead of enqueueing another copy.
- This closes a route-retry amplification path where repeated CIS scan submissions for the same baseline and device set could otherwise stack duplicate benchmark runs.

### R-209: Manual offline detection requests now deduplicate by threshold and queue window
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/offlineDetector.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/offlineDetector.ts)

Summary:
- On-demand offline detection now assigns a stable BullMQ `jobId` derived from the threshold parameter and a short dedupe slot, and it reuses already active queue entries instead of scheduling another identical detection pass.
- This closes a duplicate-enqueue path where repeated test or retry calls could otherwise stack redundant full-device offline scans.

### R-210: Automation run execution now claims queue identity from the logical run ID
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/automationWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/automationWorker.ts)

Summary:
- `enqueueAutomationRun(runId)` now uses a stable BullMQ `jobId` derived from the logical automation run ID and reuses an already active queue entry instead of blindly adding another execution job for the same run row.
- This closes a duplicate-execution path where route retries, schedule retries, or concurrent callers could otherwise execute the same automation run more than once.

### R-211: Session-broker backup IPC responses now validate payload `commandId`
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/session.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/session.go)

Summary:
- Pending backup helper responses now validate the payload-level `commandId` from `backup_result` messages against the original `backup_command` request before delivering the envelope to the waiting caller.
- This closes the same payload-correlation gap previously fixed for generic command results and desktop-start replies, where a helper could reuse the right envelope ID but smuggle a different logical backup command identity in the payload.

### R-212: Only desktop-authorized helpers may update broker TCC permission state
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go)

Summary:
- The broker now rejects unsolicited `tcc_status` messages from helpers that do not hold desktop scope, instead of accepting and storing that permission state on the session.
- This closes a trust-boundary gap where a non-desktop helper, including non-capture roles, could previously poison the broker’s macOS permission view and influence later desktop/TCC decisions.

### R-213: Log-forwarding jobs now cap queued event count and drop oversized raw payloads
Location:
- [/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/logForwardingWorker.ts](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/logForwardingWorker.ts)

Summary:
- Log-forwarding enqueue now trims hostname and per-event string fields, caps each queued batch to a bounded number of events, and drops `rawData` blobs whose serialized size exceeds a fixed budget.
- This closes a queue-memory amplification path where a caller could previously submit arbitrarily large event arrays or oversized raw payloads and push that unbounded body directly into Redis.

### R-214: User-risk signal-event jobs now cap string fields and reject oversized detail payloads

Summary:
- User-risk signal-event enqueue now truncates oversized `eventType` and `description` fields and drops `details` objects whose serialized size exceeds a fixed budget before queueing the job.
- This closes a queue-memory amplification path where an attacker who could reach that enqueue path could otherwise stuff oversized free-form metadata into BullMQ and downstream persistence.

## Suggested Next Audit Targets

1. The remaining API queue surface is now mostly event-carrying or data-carrying jobs where naive dedupe could drop legitimate work, especially [`/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/logForwardingWorker.ts`](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/logForwardingWorker.ts) and [`/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/userRiskJobs.ts`](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/userRiskJobs.ts) for `process-signal-event`. Those need a semantics-aware pass rather than the mechanical stable-`jobId` pattern used above.
2. The next non-queue trust-boundary target remains the agent/session layer, but it is now down to any remaining helper response families beyond generic command, desktop-start, and backup-result payload correlation. The likely yield is another pass across unsolicited helper message handling in [`/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go`](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/broker.go) and any other typed helper replies outside [`/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/session.go`](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/agent/internal/sessionbroker/session.go).
3. If the audit stays on the API side, the next likely yield is another pass through automation/config-policy execution in [`/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/automationWorker.ts`](/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze/apps/api/src/jobs/automationWorker.ts) for any remaining secondary queue hops that still lack stable logical identity.
