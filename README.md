## What is Breeze?

Breeze is a full-featured remote monitoring and management platform with AI built into its core — not bolted on as an afterthought.

Software features are exploding, but people can't keep up. Every RMM on the market adds more buttons, more tabs, more dashboards. Breeze takes a different approach: **an AI agent that actually uses the features for you.** It investigates alerts, remediates issues, documents what it did, and only bothers you when it needs a human decision.

Breeze is free, open source (AGPL-3.0), and designed to be self-hosted or [cloud-hosted at breezermm.com](https://breezermm.com).

### Why Breeze?

- **AI-native, not AI-added.** Every page has an AI assistant that can see what you see and take action using built-in tools. Not a chatbot — an agent.
- **Lightweight agent.** Single Go binary. Cross-platform. Minimal resource footprint. Your clients won't notice it's there.
- **Actually open source.** AGPL-3.0. Read every line. Fork it. Contribute. No bait-and-switch.
- **Multi-tenant from day one.** Built for MSPs managing multiple clients, not retrofitted from a single-tenant architecture.
- **Modern stack.** Not a legacy codebase with 15 years of technical debt. Clean, fast, extensible.

## Security

Breeze has privileged access to every device it manages. We take that seriously.

| Layer | What We Do |
|---|---|
| **Authentication** | Argon2id passwords, JWT with 15-min expiry, TOTP MFA, SHA-256 hashed tokens, email verification on signup |
| **Authorization** | RBAC with scope-based multi-tenancy, forced PostgreSQL row-level security on every tenant table — no app-layer-only fallback, even table owners can't bypass |
| **Encryption** | AES-256-GCM at rest, TLS 1.2+ in transit, HSTS preload, no plaintext secrets stored anywhere |
| **Agent hardening** | Bearer token auth (SHA-256 hashed), 0600 config file permissions, optional Cloudflare mTLS |
| **Rate limiting** | Redis sliding window on all auth endpoints and agent APIs — fail-closed if Redis is unavailable |
| **Input validation** | Zod schemas on every external input — API requests, WebSocket messages, query parameters |
| **AI safety** | Risk-classified action engine — dangerous operations require human approval, critical operations blocked entirely |
| **Supply chain** | 5 automated scanners in CI: CodeQL SAST, Gitleaks, npm audit, govulncheck, Trivy CVE scanning |
| **Audit trail** | Structured audit logging with actor tracking, org-scoped retention policies, S3 archival |
| **Operational** | Secret rotation runbooks, disaster recovery procedures (RTO < 1 hour, RPO < 15 minutes) |
| **Abuse controls** | Cross-tenant platform-admin suspend endpoint, email-verification gate on signup, fail-closed token revocation |

For the full security whitepaper, including SOC 2 alignment mapping, see **[Security Practices](docs/SECURITY_PRACTICES.md)**.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Cloud Hosted (Easiest)

Skip infrastructure entirely. [Sign up at breezermm.com](https://breezermm.com) and have a fully managed Breeze instance in minutes.

### Option 2: Self-Hosted (Docker)

Requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose.

```bash
mkdir breeze && cd breeze
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanternops/breeze/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanternops/breeze/main/.env.example
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env — at minimum set these:
#   BREEZE_DOMAIN        your domain (or "localhost" for local testing)
#   ACME_EMAIL           email for Let's Encrypt certs
#   JWT_SECRET           openssl rand -base64 64
#   AGENT_ENROLLMENT_SECRET  openssl rand -hex 32
#   APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY   openssl rand -hex 32
#   MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY   openssl rand -hex 32
#   ENROLLMENT_KEY_PEPPER    openssl rand -base64 32
#   MFA_RECOVERY_CODE_PEPPER openssl rand -base64 32
#   BREEZE_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL     your admin email, first boot only
#   BREEZE_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD  one-time value from `openssl rand -base64 32`

# Optional — for remote desktop (WebRTC TURN relay):
#   TURN_HOST            public IP of your TURN server
#   TURN_SECRET          openssl rand -hex 32

docker compose up -d

# To enable TURN for remote desktop across NATs/firewalls:
# docker compose --profile turn up -d
```

Breeze will be running at `https://your-domain` (or `https://localhost` with a self-signed cert for local testing).

On first production boot against an empty database, Breeze creates the initial Partner Admin only from operator-provided `BREEZE_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `BREEZE_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` values. If those values are missing, startup refuses to seed the empty production database. The password is never printed to logs. After you sign in and finish setup, remove those bootstrap values from `.env`.

### Install the Agent

From your Breeze dashboard, navigate to **Settings → Agents → Download** to get the agent installer for your platform.

Or install directly:

```bash
# Build from source
cd agent
make build

# Binaries land in agent/bin/ — including breeze-agent, breeze-desktop-helper,
# breeze-watchdog, and breeze-backup.
# See docs/AGENT_INSTALLATION.md for enrollment instructions.
```

### Enable the AI Brain (Optional)

1. Go to **Settings → AI Brain → BYOK**
2. Enter your [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)
3. The AI assistant is now active on every page

## AI Brain

Breeze ships with the Claude Agent SDK integrated and an MCP server you can point any AI agent at. The AI isn't a separate product or plugin — it's woven into the platform, and the same risk engine governs every action whether it comes from the in-product chat or from an external agent over MCP.

### How It Works

The AI brain has access to **tools** — the same capabilities you have in the dashboard. When you ask it to investigate an alert, it can query device details, check event logs, run diagnostic scripts, and propose remediations. When it decides to take an action, that action passes through the **risk engine** before execution.

```
You: "Why is ACME-WS05 running slow?"

Brain: I'll investigate. Let me check the device health.
       → [calls get_device_details]
       → [calls get_event_stream]
       → [calls run_script: Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select -First 10]

       ACME-WS05 has high CPU from Windows Update stuck in a retry loop.
       KB5034441 failed with error 0x80070643 — the recovery partition
       is too small. I can fix this by extending the partition and
       retrying the update.

       ⚠️ This requires running a disk partition script (Risk: High).
       Approve? [Yes] [Modify] [Deny]
```

### Risk Classification

Every action the AI can take is classified by risk level. This is enforced by the RMM, not the AI — the brain cannot bypass it.

| Risk Level | Behavior | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Low** | Auto-execute, logged | Query devices, read logs, generate reports |
| **Medium** | Execute + notify tech | Run read-only scripts, deploy pre-approved patches |
| **High** | Requires human approval | State-changing scripts, patches outside maintenance window |
| **Critical** | Blocked entirely | Wipe device, bulk destructive operations |

Risk policies are fully configurable per partner, organization, site, or device group.

### BYOK vs LanternOps Brain

| AI chat on every page | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tool-equipped agent | ✅ | ✅ |
| Risk-classified actions | ✅ | ✅ |
| Persistent memory | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cross-tenant intelligence | ❌ | ✅ |
| Automated playbooks | ❌ | ✅ |

## Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Hierarchy

```
Partner (MSP) → Organization (Customer) → Site (Location) → Device Group → Device
```

Every entity in Breeze is scoped to this hierarchy. Permissions, policies, alerts, and AI risk classifications cascade down and can be overridden at any level.

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Astro + React Islands |
| API | Hono (TypeScript) |
| Database | PostgreSQL with forced row-level security + Drizzle ORM |
| Queue | BullMQ + Redis |
| Agent | Go (cross-platform); native helper/viewer in Tauri (Rust) |
| Real-time | WebSocket + HTTP polling |
| Remote Access | WebRTC + coturn TURN relay |
| Reverse Proxy | Caddy with automatic Let's Encrypt |
| AI | Claude Agent SDK (Anthropic), MCP server with OAuth 2.1 |

### Brain Connector

The Brain Connector is the interface between the RMM and any AI brain (BYOK or LanternOps). It exposes RMM capabilities as Agent SDK tools and enforces risk classification on every action.

## FAQ

**Is this really free?**
Yes. Breeze is AGPL-3.0 licensed. Self-host it, use it in production, manage as many endpoints as you want. Free forever.

**What's the catch?**
No catch. The business model is [LanternOps](https://lanternops.io) — a managed AI brain that connects to Breeze and adds persistent memory, cross-tenant intelligence, automated playbooks, and compliance evidence. Breeze is great on its own. LanternOps makes it autonomous.

**How is this different from Tactical RMM?**
Tactical RMM is a solid project. Breeze is AI-native — the agent SDK and tool system are core to the architecture, not an integration. We also have built-in remote access (WebRTC), a modern frontend (Astro + React), and a multi-tenant hierarchy designed for MSPs from day one.

**Can I use this for my internal IT team (not an MSP)?**
Absolutely. The multi-tenant hierarchy works for internal IT too — just use Organizations as departments or offices.

**What AI models are supported?**
For the in-product AI chat, Breeze uses the Claude Agent SDK (Anthropic). BYOK mode requires an Anthropic API key. We chose Claude for its tool-use capabilities and reasoning quality. Separately, Breeze runs a built-in MCP server with OAuth 2.1 + PKCE, so you can connect Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Cursor, or any other MCP-compatible AI agent — using whichever model that platform runs. We're open to community contributions for additional in-product model providers.

**Is there an agent auto-update?**
Yes. The Breeze agent has a built-in updater that pulls signed release artifacts and self-installs across macOS, Windows, and Linux. The Watchdog service supervises the agent process and restarts it on failure. Production deployments verify Ed25519-signed release manifests via `RELEASE_ARTIFACT_MANIFEST_PUBLIC_KEYS`.

**Is my data safe?**
Self-hosted: your data never leaves your infrastructure. Cloud-hosted: data is isolated per partner with strict tenant separation. See our [Security Practices](docs/SECURITY_PRACTICES.md) for the full security whitepaper, including SOC 2 alignment mapping, encryption standards, and audit controls.
