    // proxy: that proxy dispatches under its own `/api/v1/client-ai/ext/:extension/*`
    // mount with a synthesized organization-scoped context, and clientGate
    // (inside createClientRoutes) admits exactly that shape.
    //
    // That proxy does not exist in this repo yet — it is unmerged, on
    // ToddHebebrand/client-ext-seam-w4. Mounting `/client` here anyway would
    // NOT reach it; the extension gateway would route `/client/*` down its
    // default arm, i.e. an ordinary browser session JWT. clientGate checks the
    // SHAPE of the auth context, not its provenance, so any organization-scoped
    // Breeze user would satisfy it — and `/client/*` would become the only
    // Workspace surface an org-scoped user can reach at all, since adminGate
    // rejects that scope outright. That is an intra-org authorization gap (mail
    // metadata search, filing decisions overwritable by any org user), so the
    // mount waits for its dispatcher.

    // routing createClientRoutes into the app below, and belongs with whichever
    // commits from that branch land the proxy. Note when doing so that the
    // proxy's synthesized context sets no `principal` field, so a provenance
    // check on clientGate cannot key off `principal.kind` as-is.

    // real mount had one: without it, `/client/*` falls through to the
